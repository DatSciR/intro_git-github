# intro_git-github_eng
Don't panic if you think git and github are confusing and not very intuitive.
 People who have been using them for many years think so too.
 Here we try to explain in a simple way the basic principles of git
 and github and how to solve common problems.
 The document is made with the aim of implementing it in R 
so we recommend taking a look at [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)
 beforehand. Note that most of the steps can be made either in the terminal or
 by clicking buttons in RStudio so we tried to mix both.
