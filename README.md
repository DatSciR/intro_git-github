# intro_git-github_eng
This document briefly explains the basic logic of how git works as well as some of the basic commands for handling it. It is made with the aim of implementing it in R so I recommend taking a look at [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) beforehand. Note that most of the steps can be made either in the terminal or by clicking buttons in Rstudio so I tried to mix both.
